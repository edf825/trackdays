# UK track day calendar

This is a scraper of the major track day providers in the UK:
 * MSV;
 * No Limits;
 * Focused Events; and
 * Trackdays.co.uk (actually an agency, but they pull together a lot of sources I couldn't be bothered scraping myself).

It can be seen at https://edf825.github.io/trackdays/

All code is in the public domain. Data is likely copyright the respective
source.

All this code is terrible. Please don't think this is my idea of good code.
